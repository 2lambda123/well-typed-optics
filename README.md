[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/well-typed/optics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/well-typed/optics)
[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/optics.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics)

This package provides optics (as in the
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) package) but encapsulates them
in an abstract interface. See the Haddocks for the main `Optics` module for the
documentation.

There is no official Hackage release yet, but you can preview Haddock documentation (as of 2019-06-10) [here](https://rybczak.net/files/optics/optics-0.1-docs/Optics.html) (or [here](https://rybczak.net/files/optics) for other subpackages).
