# optics

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/well-typed/optics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/well-typed/optics)

The `optics` family of Haskell packages make it possible to define and use
Lenses, Traversals, Prisms and other *optics*, using an abstract interface. They
are roughly comparable in functionality with the
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) package, but explore a different
part of the design space. For a detailed introduction, see the Haddocks for the
main `Optics` module.

There is no official Hackage release yet, but you can preview Haddock
documentation (as of 2019-06-10)
[here](https://rybczak.net/files/optics/optics-0.1-docs/Optics.html) (or
[here](https://rybczak.net/files/optics) for other subpackages).


## Authors and contributors

The authors of the `optics` family of packages are:

 * Adam Gundry
 * Andres LÃ¶h
 * Andrzej Rybczak
 * Oleg Grenrus

Our thanks go to those who have (involuntarily) contributed code and ideas to
`optics`. In particular, we have liberally reused parts of the `lens` package by
Edward Kmett and contributors.


## Package structure

### Offically supported packages

 * `optics` is a "batteries-included" package with many dependencies. It
   incorporates:

   * `optics-core`: core definitions with a minimal dependency footprint.

   * `optics-extra`: extra definitions and instances that extend `optics-core`,
     incurring dependencies on various boot library packages.

   * `optics-th`: machinery to construct optics using `TemplateHaskell`.

 * `optics-vl`: utilities for compatibility with van Laarhoven isomorsphims and
   prisms, as defined in the `lens` library.  This package is not included in
   `optics` as it imposes a dependency on `profunctors`.  Note that
   `optics-core` already supports conversion for van Laarhoven lenses and
   various other optics.

### Work in progress packages

These packages have not (yet) been officially released. If you find them
useful, we would welcome offers to maintain these packages.

 * `generic-optics`: generic construction of optics using the `generic-lens`
   package.

 * `optics-sop`: generic construction of optics using the `generics-sop`
   package, and optics for `generics-sop` types.

 * `template-haskell-optics`: optics for working with types in the
   `template-haskell` package (see `optics-th` for *using* `TemplateHaskell` to
   construct optics).

### Internal packages

These packages are for internal use only, and are not intended to be released:

 * `metametapost`: generates diagrams used in the documentation, and an example
   of using `optics`.

 * `optics-codegen`: code generator for the `Is` class and `Join` type family
   used internally by `optics`.
